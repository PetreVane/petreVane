### Hi there 👋   

 ##### I'm currently doing corporate synergy in a cubicle farm 🏢 
 
 ##### I do a very specific job and my professional interests are limited to my assigned tasks. Everything else is a waste of time. 

##### I’m interested into:

- Legacy Monoliths & spaghetti code 
- Manual FTP Deployments on Fridays
- Development: Enterprise Java, COBOL and some other shady scripting language no one else ever heard of
- Ignoring alerts in Windows Server administration


##### I'm a big fan of proprietary software, stacked windows and always on-trial JetBrains IDEs 👍 

##### I'm NOT active in the meetup scene. If you see me at a mandatory corporate event, I'm just trying to get through the day. There's no need for small talk. 🙅‍♂️

#### Getting in touch ? 
I am extremely offline, so the best way to reach me is to send me a post card. I have a profile on linkedin and I check it obsessively but only when sitting on toilet.  
Feel free to contact me but... why would you do that?? 🤔

##### Fun facts:
- I use the default hostname for all of my computers 💻
- I run MacOs (btw). There's no point in wasting my time configuring a terminal or running Arch. My kid needs me more than my command line.
- On my own time, I like to forget computers exist, drink instant tap water from the office kitchen, use whatever mechanical keyboard is cheapest and watch network television. 📺
