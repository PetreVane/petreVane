### Hi there 👋   

I'm currently doing corporate synergy in a cubicle farm 🏢 
 
I do a very specific job and my professional interests are limited to my assigned tasks. Everything else is a waste of my time. 

#### I’m interested into:

- Legacy Monoliths & spaghetti code - you can't really mess up something that's already messed up
- Manual FTP Deployments on Fridays
- Development: Enterprise Java, COBOL, Fortran and Brainfuck
- Ignoring alerts in Windows Server administration
- Permission policies like this one:
```json

{
        "Effect" : "Allow",
        "Action" : "*",
        "Resource" : "*"
}

```

 I'm a big fan of proprietary software, stacked windows and always on-trial JetBrains IDEs 👍 

 I'm NOT active in the meetup scene. If you see me at a mandatory corporate event, I'm just trying to get through the day. There's no need for small talk. 🙅‍♂️

#### Getting in touch ? 
I am extremely offline, so the best way to reach me is to not reach me at all. I have a profile on linkedin but this is only to look professional.  
Feel free to contact me but... why would you do that?? 🤔

#### Fun facts:
- I use the default hostname for all of my computers 💻
- I run MacOs, by the way & **NOT** Arch like the cool dudes. There's no point in wasting my time configuring a terminal.
- On my own time, I drink instant tap water from the office kitchen, use whatever mechanical keyboard is cheapest and watch network television. 📺
